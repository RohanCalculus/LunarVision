# üåô Segment Lunar Terrain using Computer Vision
Give input image of Moon Terrain which is at least 480x480 pixels and get the segmented mask as output.
* Note that, the segmentation mask will only include those rocks which might be dangerous for rover!

## üîß Tools used in This Project
1. **FastAPI** - To build the API endpoints
2. **Streamlit** - To build and host the frontend of the web application
3. **Keras** - To build the dataset pipeline, model, perform training and evaluation
4. **UNET**:- Architecture selected for performing Image Segmentation
5. **Transfer Learning** - Using SOTA backbone for UNET to get better results in no time 
6. **Matplotlib** - To visualize the cost vs iterations and in the web application to visualize the regression line
7. **Pandas** - To read CSV files, create the dataframe, and save dataframes back to CSV
8. **PIL** - For displaying image as output in FastAPI response and on Streamlit web app
